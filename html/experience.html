                        This certificate taught me the skills of automating tasks by writing python scripts, 
                        managing IT resources at scale, both for physical machines and virtual machines in the cloud,
                        and analyzing real-world IT problems and implement the appropriate strategies to solve those problems.

                    <p>
                        In a dynamic and high-paced work setting, I led a team of up to five 
                        skilled technicians, ensuring not only their efficiency but also the overall 
                        organization of operations. My role extended to effective customer communication, 
                        guaranteeing that their specific requirements were met to their satisfaction. 
                        Furthermore, I took on the responsibility of promptly resolving any challenges 
                        encountered by the technicians during their service tasks, ultimately streamlining 
                        job completion and enhancing overall efficiency.
